Oct 2002: taken over by B. D. Ripley

Document more of the functions, split up RODBC.Rd and odbc.Rd 
into smaller pages.

Add a test suite.

Change the interface to remove all this as.character(substitute(foo)).

Works out what sqlCopy should do.

Use the column information in the table to choose the types in the 
data frame rather than use type.convert.

Allow automated transfer of time stamps.

Handle the decimal point more elegantly.  
(Can ODBC tell us what the database uses?)
