Oct 2002: taken over by B. D. Ripley

Add a real test suite.

Allow automated transfer of time stamps.

Handle the decimal point more elegantly.  
(Can ODBC tell us what the database uses?  Seems not.)

Replace internal table of handles by external references?

Consider removing the 255 char limit, at least when reading from the 
DBMS.
